# EndangeredLanguagesSonification 

## Description
A Final Project for Music 128 where I was tasked with creating a data sonification. At the time 
I was taking Linguis R1B (a class on endangered languages), and Stat 33b (Advanced Programming in R) 
and chose to use this project as a means of mixing these three classes together. 

## Navigating this Repo   

### Accessing the PDF 
For full documentation on how this project was created, go to the main repo and navigate to "FinalProjectMarkdown.pdf". 

### Accessing Videos  
Unfortunately, I haven't uploaded any of these videos onto Youtube or any video hosting platform so the only way
to view the sonifications is to download the mp4 files located in the repo.  

## TLDR Project Specs 

### Necessary Packages 
The packages utilized: 
<br/>```tidyverse``` - For processing the csv.  
<br/>```gganimate``` - For creating the actual animations used in the final videos. 
<br/>```maps``` - For plotting the data points onto a map.
<br/>```av``` - For downloading the plots into .mp4 files which were editted later to have audio.

### Outside Tech 
For audio I used TwoTones which basically turns the data into audio.
